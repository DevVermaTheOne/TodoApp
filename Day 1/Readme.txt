Well I need to plan things out here:
Lets start with a simple project. I am going to make a todo app using python and mysql that works using command line
Then there are two paths to go: 
adding gui functionality
adding online functionality
Lets create a basic app first and then think about future steps.
Why this app? Seems like a good place to start. Also, could turn out to be a productivity booster even for me. My goal is to journal my development process. See what works and what doesn't.

Current plan:
allow users to add tasks and summary 
remove tasks
change status of tasks(pending/completed)
be able to view these tasks
